This midterm project is about how to create a contact form.

And that upon form submission, the user will be redirected to a confirmation page that displays the data they submitted.


The errors that I have with the code is that the 'other' section in the subject list does not work or that I didn't have enough time to add the function.

Also with the agreement function when it gets relayed to the confirmation page it does not show if the user clicked it or not.

But other than that those are the only problems that I have encountered.
